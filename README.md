# Algorithm-Development-Template

## Trading Algorithms Template Repository

This repository serves as a template for developing, testing, and deploying trading algorithms. It provides a structured framework that includes components for backtesting, live trading, and a dashboard interface. The core utilities, configurations, and strategies are organized to ensure modularity and ease of maintenance.

### Folder Descriptions

- **backtesting**: Contains notebooks, scripts, and data for simulating trading strategies using historical data. This helps in evaluating the performance of algorithms before deploying them live.
  - `backtesting-algo.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for running backtests and analyzing results.
  - `data`: Stores historical market data used for backtesting.
  - `data-formatters`: Scripts or tools to format and preprocess raw data for backtesting.

- **dashboard**: Houses the web-based dashboard for visualizing algorithm performance and monitoring live trading activities.
  - `algo-dashboard`: Main directory for dashboard code.
    - `static`: Contains static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
    - `templates`: HTML templates for the dashboard's user interface.

- **docs**: Documentation for setting up, configuring, and using the algorithms.
  - `setup_guide.md`: Guide to help users set up the environment and get started with the algorithms.

- **live-engine**: Core engine for live trading, including configuration, data management, and execution logic.
  - `logs`: Directory for storing log files generated during live trading.
    - `logs.log`: Example log file for tracking trades, errors, and other events.
  - `config`: Configuration files required for setting up and running the algorithms.
    - `config.ini`: Sample configuration file with parameters for live trading, such as API keys, trading pairs, risk management settings, etc.

  - `data`: Folder for storing runtime data, including in-memory data and saved data for later analysis.
    - `memory-data`: Temporary data stored during live trading.
      - saved-data`: Persistent data storage for logs, historical trade data, and analysis results.
  - `src`: Source code directory containing all modules required for live trading.
    - `core`: Core functionalities shared across different strategies, such as order execution and data fetching.
    - `strategy`: Implementations of specific trading strategies.
    - `utils`: Utility functions and helper scripts.
    - `main.py`: Starting point of the script


- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the algorithms. Install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/trading-algorithms-template.git
   cd trading-algorithms-template
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Your Environment**:
   Edit the `config/config.ini` file to set up your API keys, trading pairs, and other parameters according to your trading strategy and environment.

4. **Run Backtests**:
   Use the Jupyter notebook in the `backtesting` folder to test your trading strategies with historical data. Open the notebook with:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook backtesting/backtesting-algo.ipynb
   ```

5. **Deploy Live Trading**:
   Ensure your environment is properly configured and run the live trading engine. Navigate to the `live-engine/src` folder and execute your main trading script:
   ```bash
   python live-engine/src/main.py
   ```

6. **Monitor Performance**:
   Launch the dashboard to monitor your trading algorithm in real-time. Navigate to the `dashboard` directory and start the web server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```

## cd dashboard/algoDashboard
how to run dashboard:  python app.py
